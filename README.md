## Deep Learning Compiler Study
This is a repository of the study "DL Compiler". The goal of this study is to understand the acceleration of nerual networks with DL Compiler. The topic of acceleration includes `On-Device AI`,`DL Compiler`, `TVM`, `ONNX` , `Compiler`. Our materials are open to git and youtube. This study is supported by [NOTA](https://nota.ai). Thank you NOTA !


Our study is based on this paper (`The Deep Learning Compiler: A Comprehensive Survey`, IEEE TPDS 2021).
